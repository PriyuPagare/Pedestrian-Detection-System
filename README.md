# Pedestrian-Detection-System

Pedestrian detection and counting through video is a technology that utilizes 
computer vision algorithms to detect and track pedestrians in video footage. It works by 
analyzing each frame of the video to identify human-like shapes and movements, then 
counting the number of pedestrians detected. This technology is commonly used in 
surveillance systems and public safety applications to monitor pedestrian flow, optimize 
urban planning, and enhance security measures.
